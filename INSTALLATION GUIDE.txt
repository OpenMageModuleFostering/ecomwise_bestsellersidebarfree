---- INSTALL NOTES ----

1. Copy the folders (and its content): "app","js" and "skin" to your root magento directory
2. If you are not using the default theme, then additionaly copy the following files and folders to your theme directory:
	app/design/frontend/default/default/layout/callme.xml   (file)
        app/design/frontend/default/default/template/callme     (folder and its content) 
3.Clear the magento cache
4.Log out and log in again in your magento admin
5. For older versions like Magento 1.3.x it might be even needed for you to explicitely clear the magento cache files from /root/var/cache
   So, once you are here, select all folders, and delete them including their content.
6. One additional measure that might need to be applied for Magento 1.3.x versions might be to clear your browser history (browser cache)

-- IMPORTANT NOTE --

Due to translating Java script purposes this extension overrides the Magento core file:
app/code/core/Mage/Core/Helper/Js.php 
by using the file:
app/code/core/Mage/Core/Helper/Js.php 

The changes are actually a added java script error for translation on lines: 208-209


If you already have a override of the Js.php file just make sure to copy these two lines 
from the extension file and put it in the already present one.
If not you are risking to loose the previous overrides.


---- CONFIGURATION ----

In the magento admin browse to: System->Configuration, 
and then under the "General" tab, look for the "Call me" link.

Two parameters are editable:
	- the "email" to whom the request for call will be sent
	- the "frontend message", which is purely the text that shows in the block 
		after the user has submitted the form successfully
	- the "default message", which is purely the text that shows in the block by default




---- USAGE ----

You can call the block with a code simmilar to:

<reference name="reference_name">
	<block type="Ecomwise_Callme/callme" name="block_name" template="callme/callme.phtml"></block>
</reference> 


---- COMPATIBILITY ----

Magento 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2
Magento 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2
